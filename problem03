1)A string slice can take a third index that specifies the "step size;" that is, the number of spaces between successive characters. A step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every third, etc.
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[0:5:2]
'bnn'

def isPal(a):
    b=a[::-1]
    print(b)
    if a==b:
     return "Its a palindrome
    else:
        return "Its not a palindrome"

a=str(input("Enter the string : "))
print(isPal(a))


2)Write a function called rotate_word() that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that returns a new string that contains 
the letters from the original string "rotated" by the given amount. For example, "cheer" rotated by 7 is "jolly" and "melon" rotated 
by -10 is "cubed". You might want to use the built-in functions ord, which converts a character to a numeric code, and chr, 
which converts numeric codes to characters.




3)In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called Gadsby that does not contain the letter "e." 
Since "e" is the most common letter in English, that’s not easy to do. In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought 
without using that most common symbol. It is slow going at first, but with caution and hours of training you can gradually gain facility.
All right, I’ll stop now. Write a function called has_no_e that returns True if the given word doesn’t have the letter "e" in it.


def  has_no_e(a):
    if 'e'  in a:
        return True
    else:
        return False

a='eagle'
res=has_no_e(a)
print(res)

-------------------------------or---------------------

li=[]
def  has_no_e(a):
    for i in a:
        if 'e'  in a:
            return True
        else:
            return False

a='eagle'
res=has_no_e(a)
print(res)


4)Modify the above program to print only the words that have no “e” and compute the percentage of the words in the list have no “e.”

def  has_no_e(a):
    word=a.split(" ")
    li = []
    for a in word:
        if 'e' not  in word:
            li.append(word)
    percentage = 100*(len(li)/100)
    print(percentage)
a='Hello this is abi working on python programee'
res=has_no_e(a)
print(res)


5)Write a function named avoids that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and that returns True if the word doesn’t 
use any of the forbidden letters.

def fun(a,b):
    for a  in b:
        if b not in a:
            return False
        else:
            return True

a=input("Enter a word : ")
b=input("Enter a string : ")
res=fun(a,b)
print(res)


6)Modify your program to prompt the user to enter a string of forbidden letters and then print the number of words that don’t 
contain any of them. Can you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters that excludes the smallest number of words?
