1)A string slice can take a third index that specifies the "step size;" that is, the number of spaces between successive characters. A step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every third, etc.
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[0:5:2]
'bnn'

def isPal(a):
    b=a[::-1]
    print(b)
    if a==b:
     return "Its a palindromWrite a function called rotate_word() that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string "rotated" by the given amount. For example, "cheer" rotated by 7 is "jolly" and "melon" rotated by -10 is "cubed". You might want to use the built-in functions ord, 
        which converts a character to a numeric code, and chr, which converts numeric codes to characters.e"
    else:
        return "Its not a palindrome"

a=str(input("Enter the string : "))
print(isPal(a))
